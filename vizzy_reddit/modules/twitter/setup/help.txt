Navigate to https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps

Create a project, create an app, blah blah blah

Open App Settings, and go to "User Authentication Settings" and click "Set up"

Choose what you need (Read and write, usually), then "Web App, Automated App, or Bot".  The rest of the info is not relevant to a basic bot - redirect URI is for logging into the app, which we don't need to do.

Click "Save"

Apply for Elevated Access here - Can't find a link, google it or reference https://twittercommunity.com/t/cannot-access-api-from-python-unauthorised-error/172872

Grab API keys.  You want the USER ID and Key, NOT OAUTH
