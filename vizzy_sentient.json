In the show he sows the same seeds but we're shown a lot more of why he did what he did. And we watch the weight of his family's squabbling and legacy slowly crush him. He's also shown to be a stronger and more dutiful man than his book counterpart. Book Viserys cuts his hand on the Iron Throne two years before his death, gets an infection that requires amputation, and never sits the Throne again. Show Viserys drags his own rotting corpse to the Throne to try and defend his daughter and forestall the Dance. And then he spends the last night of his life trying to mend the divide between Green and Black with the last of his energy.\n\nI think the addition of him slowly dying over the decades was a pretty great one too, in the book he just kind of gets weak and eventually his heart gives out towards the end of his life.

It also seemed to me that 'milk of the poppy' was essentially the sub plot of this episode. Yes, it relieved Vissy T's pain, but it also enabled the Hightowers to keep him out of the throne room. \"How does he convey his wisdom?\" asked Daemon. It is also clear that the Hightowers had ample access to 'milk of the poppy.'\n\nAlicent questioned Diana as to how many she had told. She had told three, and promised not to tell anyone else; Alicent agreed. Then we were shown how 'milk of the poppy' can be used as a weapon, and poor Diana will never tell any one, ever again. Helaena then reported that Diana had failed to show up for her shift, dressing the kids. Alicent then gave her daughter a big hug.\n\nI think it is clear.
